Explored the principles of building RESTful APIs for communication between the client and server.
 
Persistence and Database Interaction:
Worked with Spring Data JPA for seamless interaction with a relational database.
Utilized JPA annotations to define entities, relationships, and database schema.
 
Entity Relationships:
Explored and implemented various types of relationships between entities, such as @ManyToOne and @OneToMany.
Managed bidirectional relationships, understanding the importance of maintaining consistency.
 
Security and Authentication:
Integrated Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.
Implemented secure endpoints, ensuring that certain operations were accessible only to authenticated users.
 
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):
Implemented Data Transfer Objects to control the information exposed to the client.
Transformed entities into DTOs to present specific views of data in API responses.
 
Pagination and Custom Queries:
Implemented pagination for large datasets using Spring Data JPA.
Created custom query methods based on naming conventions, enhancing data retrieval capabilities.
 
Handling Dates and Times:
Utilized the LocalDateTime class for capturing and managing date and time information.
Error Handling and Exception Management:
Created custom exception classes for handling specific scenarios.
Implemented exception handling in controllers to provide meaningful error responses.
 
Database Constraints and Relationships:
Managed database constraints, such as foreign key relationships, and handled scenarios where deleting entities might violate constraints.
